# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
     I struggled with this section because it's the middle of the night and I'm sleepy but I'm understanding how to plug in code more and more. My ability to understand the logic is still hard.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    Taking notes is helping me to retain the information just by jotting things down. But I'm struggling to find a way to organize my notes. I'm writing everythnig quickly so that I don't lose time while studying or I'm writing quickly to stay present in the live classees. So I've yet to find a good note taking stradegy.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    I try to solve things on my own first. Then I google. The videos online are very helpful.
